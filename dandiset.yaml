description: Brain arterioles are active, multi-cellular complexes whose diameters
  oscillate at ~ 0.1 Hz. We assess the physiological impact and spatiotemporal dynamics
  of vaso-oscillations in the awake mouse. First, vaso-oscillations in penetrating
  arterioles, which source blood from pial arterioles to the capillary bed, profoundly
  impact perfusion throughout neocortex. The modulation in flux during resting-state
  activity exceeds that of stimulus-induced activity. Second, the change in perfusion
  through arterioles relative to the change in their diameter is weak. This implies
  that the capillary bed dominates the hydrodynamic resistance of brain vasculature.
  Lastly, the phase of vaso-oscillations evolves slowly along arterioles, with a wavelength
  that exceeds the span of the cortical mantle and sufficient variability to establish
  functional cortical areas as parcels of uniform phase. The phase-gradient supports
  traveling waves in either direction along both pial and penetrating arterioles.
  This implies that waves along penetrating arterioles can mix, but not directionally
  transport, interstitial fluids.
